# Data Structures Index

- Sets [[sets]]
- Stacks [[stacks]]
- Queues [[queues]]
- Linked Lists [[linked-lists]]
- Hash Tables [[hash-tables]]
- Binary Tree [[binary-tree]]
- Resources [[resources]]

Common operations (i.e. methods) performed on data structures include:

- add()
- remove()
- sort()
- search()

Big O notation is used to analyze complexity (time & space) of these operations as the data set scales / grows.
Common time complexities:

- **FASTEST**: `O(1)` :: "constant"
- **FAST**: `O(log(n))` :: "logarithmic"
- **OKAY**: `O(n)` :: "linear"
- **SLOW**: `O(nlogn` :: log-linear""
- **SLOWEST**: `O(n^2)` :: "quadratic"
