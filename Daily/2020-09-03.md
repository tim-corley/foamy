- [x] start making daily notes
- [ ] organize & clean-up daily notes at end of day

Today I have restructured my Foamy repo to more closesly reflect the structure on my local machine. Going forward, I want to keep this Foamy project, my remote GitHub repos and my `/home/tim/Learning` folder aligned / synced.

I have also split the 'Learning' folder into: **Local** & **Push**. Local will hold notes & files that do not need to go up the a Github repo. Whereas Push will contain directories that will be pushed to GH as repos. These two directories (Local & Push) should mirror each other.

Lastly, I've mirrored this dir structure in my Code Sandbox dashboard

## Getting setup for Data Structures

```bash
➜  Push mkdir data-structures
➜  Push cd data-structures
➜  data-structures git init
➜  Push mkdir data-structures
➜  Push cd data-structures
➜  data-structures git init
```

- Misc. notes & examples (no git): /home/tim/Learning/Local/Data-Structures
- Clean notes & examples:
- Good Notes: /home/tim/GitHub/tim-corley/foamy/Data-Structures
- Sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/stacks-tests-01-ujepd

## 01 - setup project w/ jest & babel for basic Stack example

/home/tim/Learning/Push/data-structures/stacks/js-example-01

```bash
➜  js-example-01 git:(master) ✗ npm init -y
➜  js-example-01 git:(master) ✗ npm i -D jest
```
