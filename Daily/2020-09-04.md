- [ ] finish-up w/ data structures (js & python examples, with tests)
  - [x] stacks
  - [x] queues
  - [x] singly linked lists
  - [x] doubly linked lists
  - [ ] hash tables
  - [ ] trees
  - [ ] heaps
- [ ] begin study / notes on algorithms

ran into an interesting scenerio when attemting to add / run a "sandox" directory in order to experiment with the data structure classes.

goal: create a `sandox/examples.js` file and run with `$ node examples.js` in order to see output in console

issue: since i used ES6 imports/exports (using babel) for Jest testing - using the default node settings (for import) wasn't working.

solution: use the .mjs file extension (on both the files containing the data structure classses as well as the examples files) and run with the `--experimental-modules` flag

- directories / files:

```
├── hash-tables
├── linked-lists
├── queues
├── sandbox
    ├── examples.mjs
└── stacks
    ├── img
    ├── js-example-01
        ├── coverage
        ├── jest.config.js
        ├── node_modules
        ├── package.json
        ├── package-lock.json
        └── src
            ├── stack.mjs
            └── stack.test.js

    └── README.md
```

- command:

```
➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ node --experimental-modules examples.mjs
```

However, this then broke the existng Jest tests (due to the extention change). to resolve, i added the following to the `jest.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest",
    "^.+\\.mjs$": "babel-jest",
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "mjs"],
  ...
}
```
